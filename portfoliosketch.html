            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This was my sketch for the portfolio project I have been working on.
                As you can see, the sketch and the current portfolio isn't the same.
                I have made adjustments whilst developing my portfolio resulting it in looking different. 
                <br>
                I have changed my mind several times on how my portfolio website should look like. In the end, my current portfolio is what my mind wanted to stick to.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Technology used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Figma</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
             I am very happy with the outcome of my portfolio website.
            The portfolio is not the exact same as shown in the sketch
            but that was becuase of the adjusments made under developing of the website.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have spent several months on planning and developing my portfolio website.
