            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                We used Figma to plan and design the website to see how it would look like.
                After that, our group started develping the website on VSC (Visual studio code) with the use of HTML and CSS.
                This was infact a customer order meaning our group followed a customer order which was followed.
                Additionally, they gave a designmanual for us to work with.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Technology used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Figma</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
             This project was my first customer order which took around 4-5 days. All previous experience before this group project was just developing my portfolio website.
