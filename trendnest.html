            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This was a group project where me and my coleagues had to create and develop a mobile app in figma.
                Figma is a website designer used to plan and design a website before developing it.
                The point of the mobile app was an combination of the "scrolling apps" containing trends made by people.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Technology used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Figma</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
            The outcome of the app was great, I had fun participating in this group project. The project took around 4 days.
